# Another Sample Website

This is another sample website made as part of [*Learn Enough™ Git to Be
Dangerous*](http://learnenough.com/git-tutorial), possibly the greatest
beginner Git tutorial in the history of the Universe. You should totally [
check it out](http://learnenough.com/git-tutorial), and be sure to [join
the email list](http://learnenough.com/#email_list) and [follow @learnenough
](http://twitter.com/learnenough) on Twitter.

After finishing *Learn Enough™ Git to Be Dangerous*, you'll know enough Git
to be *dangerous*. This means you'll be able to use Git to track changes in
your projects, back up data, share your work with others, and collaborate
with programmers and other users of Git.

Be sure to check out my [other sample website](https://adfrench11.github.io/website/) and [repo](https://github.com/adfrench11/website) made for this tutorial, which may be infinitely more interesting than this one which I quickly created for extra git practice. :)

[official Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/).
